a) Physical Health
Getting enough sleep helps the body regulate vital systems:

‚Ä¢ Immune system: Sleep supports immune function.
‚Ä¢ Heart health: Helps maintain healthy blood pressure and reduces heart disease risk.
‚Ä¢ Metabolism: Impacts how the body processes glucose, linked to weight gain and diabetes.

b) Mental and Emotional Health
Adequate sleep improves cognitive functions (attention, problem-solving, creativity), processes information and forms memories, and improves emotional regulation, reducing mood swings, anxiety, and depression risk.

c) Sleep Quality Factors
Temperature, noise levels, and light exposure all affect sleep quality.'''
