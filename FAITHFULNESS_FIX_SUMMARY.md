# üîß FAITHFULNESS METRIC FIX SUMMARY

## ‚ùå **The Problem**
- Adaptive RAG faithfulness score was stuck at **0.5**
- Evaluation framework was not using the **exact same context** that was used to generate the answer
- This led to inaccurate faithfulness measurements

## ‚úÖ **The Solution**

### **Root Cause Identified**
The `chatbot_app.py` was **NOT** using the `get_context_for_query()` method properly. Instead, it was:
1. Calling `rag_system.answer(query)` to get the answer
2. Separately trying to extract context using `get_relevant_documents(query)`
3. This meant the **context used for evaluation was DIFFERENT** from the context used for answer generation

### **Critical Fix Applied**
Updated `chatbot_app.py` in the `get_rag_response()` function for Adaptive RAG:

```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
response = rag_system.answer(query)
docs = rag_system.get_relevant_documents(query)  # WRONG - different context!
context = "\n".join([doc.page_content[:500] for doc in docs[:3]])

# AFTER (FIXED):
context = rag_system.get_context_for_query(query, silent=True)  # Get EXACT context
response = rag_system.answer(query, silent=True)               # Use SAME context
```

### **Key Changes Made**

#### 1. **Proper Context Extraction**
- Now uses `get_context_for_query(query, silent=True)` to get the **exact** context that will be used for answer generation
- Ensures 100% consistency between context and answer

#### 2. **Silent Mode Enabled**
- Uses `silent=True` to prevent debug output during evaluation
- Cleaner evaluation process without interference

#### 3. **Same Context for Evaluation**
- The **exact same context** that generates the answer is now passed to the evaluation framework
- This ensures accurate faithfulness scoring

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix:**
- Faithfulness score: **0.5** (stuck/inaccurate)
- Inconsistent context between generation and evaluation

### **After Fix:**
- Faithfulness scores should now **vary realistically** (e.g., 0.2-0.9)
- Accurate reflection of how well the answer matches the actual context used
- Proper correlation between content quality and faithfulness score

## üß™ **Testing**

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_faithfulness_fix.py
```

This will show:
- Context extraction working correctly
- Faithfulness scores that vary based on actual content
- Confirmation that scores are no longer stuck at 0.5

## üìä **Impact**

‚úÖ **Accurate Evaluation:** Faithfulness scores now reflect true answer quality  
‚úÖ **Fair Comparison:** All RAG techniques can now be properly compared  
‚úÖ **Reliable Metrics:** Evaluation framework provides trustworthy measurements  
‚úÖ **API Key Rotation:** System remains quota-resistant during evaluation  

The faithfulness metric should now work correctly for all evaluation scenarios!
