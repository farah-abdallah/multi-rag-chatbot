# 🎉 CRAG Document Viewer Implementation - COMPLETE

## ✅ Successfully Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced CRAG System
- **✅ Source Tracking**: CRAG now tracks which document chunks were used for each answer
- **✅ New Method**: `run_with_sources()` returns both answer and detailed source information
- **✅ Metadata Preservation**: Keeps track of document paths, page numbers, and relevance scores
- **✅ Backward Compatibility**: Original `run()` method still works unchanged

### 2. Document Viewer Component
- **✅ Text Highlighting**: Automatically highlights relevant chunks in different colors
- **✅ New Tab Viewer**: Opens documents in new browser tabs with highlighted text
- **✅ Embedded Viewer**: Shows documents within the chat interface in expandable sections
- **✅ Download Support**: Users can download original documents
- **✅ Responsive Design**: Works well on desktop and mobile

### 3. Enhanced User Interface
- **✅ Source Document Links**: Automatic buttons appear after CRAG responses
- **✅ Chunk Information**: Shows relevance scores and metadata for each chunk
- **✅ Multiple View Options**: Users can choose new tab or embedded viewing
- **✅ Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when documents can't be accessed

### 4. Technical Improvements
- **✅ Fixed Syntax Issues**: Resolved f-string backslash problems
- **✅ Added Dependencies**: BeautifulSoup4 and requests for web functionality
- **✅ Integration Testing**: Created comprehensive test suites
- **✅ Documentation**: Complete implementation guide and usage instructions

## 🚀 How to Use

### For End Users:
1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run chatbot_app.py
   ```

2. **Upload Documents**: Use the file uploader to add your documents
3. **Select CRAG**: Choose "CRAG" from the RAG technique dropdown
4. **Ask Questions**: Type your question about the document
5. **View Sources**: Click the document links that appear after answers

### Example User Flow:
```
User uploads "Climate_Report.pdf" 
↓
Asks "What are the main causes of climate change?"
↓
CRAG processes and finds relevant chunks
↓
System shows answer with "📄 Source Documents" section
↓
User clicks "🔗 New Tab" or "👁️ View Here"
↓
Document opens with highlighted source text in different colors
```
