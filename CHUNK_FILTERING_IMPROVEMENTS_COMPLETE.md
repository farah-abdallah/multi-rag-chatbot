# Chunk Filtering and Highlighting Improvements - COMPLETED

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Download Button Key Collision
**Problem**: Streamlit download buttons had colliding keys causing errors
**Fix**: Added timestamp-based unique keys in `document_viewer.py`
```python
download_key = f"download_{message_id}_{hash(doc_path)}_{int(time.time() * 1000)}"
```

### 2. Stale Chunk Highlighting  
**Problem**: Previous question's chunks remained highlighted in new queries
**Fix**: Added session state clearing in `chatbot_app.py`
```python
if query:
    # Clear any previous document viewer states to prevent stale highlighting
    keys_to_clear = [key for key in st.session_state.keys() if key.startswith('show_doc_')]
    for key in keys_to_clear:
        del st.session_state[key]
```

### 3. Poor Chunk Selection and Highlighting
**Problem**: System highlighted irrelevant introductory text instead of answer-relevant content
**Fixes**:

#### A. Stricter CRAG Score Thresholds
- **Relevant chunks**: Only chunks with score >= 0.6 are stored for highlighting
- **Fallback chunks**: Only chunks with score >= 0.4 are highlighted in fallback mode
- **Updated evaluation prompt**: Added instructions to focus on direct answers vs. contextual mentions

#### B. Document Viewer Filtering
- **Score threshold**: Only highlight chunks with score >= 0.5
- **Length threshold**: Skip chunks shorter than 20 characters  
- **Generic phrase filtering**: Filter out chunks containing generic phrases like:
  - "in this document"
  - "we will explore" 
  - "we will examine"
  - "this section discusses"
  - "the following"
  - "as mentioned"

### 4. Improved Chunk Relevance Evaluation
**Enhanced prompt in `retrieval_evaluator`**:
```python
prompt_text = f"""On a scale from 0 to 1, how relevant is the following document to the query? 
Focus on whether the document directly answers or provides specific information about the query.
Avoid giving high scores to documents that only mention the topic in passing or as context.
Please respond with ONLY a number between 0 and 1, no other text.
```

## Testing Results ✅

### CRAG Chunk Filtering Test
- **PASSED**: Only high-relevance chunks (score >= 0.6) are stored for highlighting
- **PASSED**: No irrelevant introductory chunks found in results
- **Score filtering**: 0.8 score chunk was kept, 0.2 score chunk was filtered out

### Document Viewer Filtering Test  
- **PASSED**: Score filter correctly removes chunks < 0.5
- **PASSED**: Length filter removes chunks < 20 characters
- **PASSED**: Generic phrase filter works for short introductory text
- **Result**: Only 1 relevant chunk highlighted out of 3 test chunks

## Key Improvements Summary

1. **Relevance-based highlighting**: Only chunks with good relevance scores are highlighted
2. **No stale highlighting**: Previous question chunks are cleared before new queries
3. **Better chunk selection**: Generic introductory text is filtered out
4. **Unique button keys**: Download buttons no longer have key collisions
5. **Stricter evaluation**: LLM evaluates relevance more strictly to avoid context mentions

## Files Modified

- `crag.py`: Enhanced chunk scoring and storage thresholds
- `document_viewer.py`: Added filtering logic and unique keys
- `chatbot_app.py`: Added session state clearing between queries
- `helper_functions.py`: Improved encoding handling for document loading

## Next Steps (Optional Future Improvements)

1. **Semantic similarity**: Could add semantic similarity check between query and chunks
2. **Answer span detection**: Could use NLP to identify exact answer spans within chunks
3. **Chunk ranking**: Could implement more sophisticated ranking beyond simple relevance scores
4. **User feedback**: Could allow users to rate chunk relevance to improve filtering

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test CRAG filtering
python test_chunk_filtering.py

# Test simple filtering logic
python test_simple_filtering.py

# Run full chatbot to test in practice
streamlit run chatbot_app.py
```

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All major issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Download button errors fixed
- ✅ Stale chunk highlighting eliminated  
- ✅ Poor chunk selection improved
- ✅ Only relevant chunks are now highlighted
- ✅ Generic introductory text is filtered out
