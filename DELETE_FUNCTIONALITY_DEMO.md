# 🗑️ Delete Functionality - User Guide

## Overview
The chatbot now includes comprehensive delete functionality that allows users to remove specific questions and their responses, including associated ratings from the analytics database.

## Features Added

### 1. Individual Message Deletion
- **🗑️ Delete Button**: Each user question now has a delete button (🗑️) next to it
- **Smart Deletion**: When you delete a question, it automatically deletes the corresponding response
- **Rating Cleanup**: All associated ratings and evaluation data are also removed from the database

### 2. What Gets Deleted
When you click the delete button on a question:
- ✅ The user question message
- ✅ The corresponding assistant response
- ✅ Any user feedback/ratings given for that response
- ✅ All automated evaluation metrics for that response
- ✅ The evaluation record from the analytics database

### 3. User Interface

#### Delete Button Location
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┬──────┐
│ You: What are the main causes of        │ 🗑️   │
│ climate change?                         │      │
│ 12:34:56                               │      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┴──────┘
```

#### Sidebar Information
The sidebar now shows:
- **Current Session Stats**: Number of questions, responses, and available ratings
- **Management Tips**: How to use the delete functionality
- **Individual Message Management**: Guidance on selective deletion

### 4. Use Cases

#### ✅ Remove Test Questions
Delete practice queries while keeping important conversations

#### ✅ Clean Up Incorrect Queries  
Remove questions that were typed incorrectly or contained errors

#### ✅ Manage Chat History Length
Keep only the most relevant conversations for better organization

#### ✅ Privacy Management
Remove sensitive questions and responses from the history

#### ✅ Experiment Cleanup
Remove experimental queries when testing different RAG techniques

### 5. How It Works

#### Frontend (chatbot_app.py)
```python
# Each message now displays with an index and delete button
for index, message in enumerate(st.session_state.messages):
    display_message(message, index)

# Delete button appears next to user messages
if st.button("🗑️", key=f"delete_user_{message['id']}"):
    # Find and delete the conversation pair
    delete_conversation_pair(user_id, assistant_id, query_id)
```

#### Database Operations
```python
# Delete from chat history
DELETE FROM chat_sessions WHERE message_id IN (user_id, assistant_id)

# Delete from evaluations 
DELETE FROM evaluations WHERE query_id = ?
```

#### Session State Cleanup
```python
# Remove from current session
st.session_state.messages = [
    msg for msg in st.session_state.messages 
    if msg.get('id') not in deleted_ids
]
```

### 6. Safety Features

#### ✅ Confirmation Through UI
- Success messages confirm deletion
- Immediate visual feedback with page refresh

#### ✅ Database Integrity
- Transactional deletes ensure data consistency
- Error handling prevents partial deletions

#### ✅ Session Sync
- Session state immediately updated
- Auto-save count adjusted to maintain consistency

### 7. Analytics Impact

#### Before Deletion
```
Evaluations Table:
- query_id: 123
- query: "What is climate change?"
- response: "Climate change refers to..."
- technique: "CRAG"
- helpfulness: 4
- accuracy: 5
- overall_rating: 4
```

#### After Deletion
```
Evaluations Table:
- [Record completely removed]
- Analytics dashboard no longer includes this data
- Technique performance statistics updated automatically
```

### 8. Visual Enhancements

#### New CSS Styles
```css
.delete-button {
    background: #ff4757 !important;
    color: white !important;
    border-radius: 50% !important;
    width: 30px !important;
    height: 30px !important;
}

.delete-button:hover {
    background: #ff3742 !important;
    transform: scale(1.1) !important;
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### Step 3: Selective Deletion
