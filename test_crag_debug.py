In this document, we will explore sleep effects. Sleep deprivation has serious consequences:

‚Ä¢ Cognitive Impairment: Affects concentration, judgment, and decision-making skills.
‚Ä¢ Emotional Instability: More likely to experience mood disorders.
‚Ä¢ Increased Risk of Accidents: Sleepy driving is as dangerous as drunk driving.
‚Ä¢ Chronic Illnesses: Associated with heart disease, stroke, obesity, and certain cancers.

Modern Lifestyle Factors
Unfortunately, modern lifestyles often prevent people from getting enough rest. Social media, irregular schedules, shift work, and stress all contribute to widespread sleep deprivation.

The Consequences of Poor Sleep
Sleep deprivation isn't just about feeling tired - it has serious consequences:"""
