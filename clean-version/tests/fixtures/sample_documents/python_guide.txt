Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace and clear syntax.

Key Features of Python:
- Easy to learn and use
- Interpreted language
- Object-oriented programming support
- Extensive standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Strong community support

Python is widely used in:
- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data science and analytics
- Machine learning and AI
- Automation and scripting
- Desktop applications
- Scientific computing

The language follows the principle of "batteries included," meaning it comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides tools for various programming tasks without requiring external dependencies.

Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and mirrors natural language, making it an excellent choice for beginners while remaining powerful enough for experienced developers working on complex projects.
