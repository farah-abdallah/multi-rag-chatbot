# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data.

## Key Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled examples
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through trial and error

## Common Algorithms:
1. Linear Regression - for predicting continuous values
2. Decision Trees - for classification and regression
3. Neural Networks - for complex pattern recognition
4. K-Means Clustering - for grouping similar data points

## Applications:
- Image Recognition: Identifying objects in photos
- Natural Language Processing: Understanding human language
- Recommendation Systems: Suggesting products or content
- Fraud Detection: Identifying suspicious transactions

## Performance Metrics:
- Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions
- Precision: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- Recall: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

## Best Practices:
1. Data Quality: Ensure clean, representative datasets
2. Feature Engineering: Create meaningful input variables
3. Model Selection: Choose appropriate algorithms for the problem
4. Cross-Validation: Test models on unseen data
5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters
