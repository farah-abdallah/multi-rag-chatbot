Chapter 1: Introduction 
Sleep is essential for health and well-being.

The Health Benefits of Sleep
a) Physical Health
Getting enough sleep helps the body regulate vital systems:
- Immune system: Sleep supports immune function.

Chapter 2: Sleep Deprivation Effects
irregular schedules, shift work, and stress all contribute to widespread sleep deprivation.
The Consequences of Poor Sleep
Sleep deprivation isn't just about feeling tired - it has serious consequences:
- Cognitive Impairment: Affects concentration, judgment, and decision-making skills.
- Emotional Instability: More likely to experience mood disorders.
- Increased Risk of Accidents: Sleepy driving is as dangerous as drunk driving."""
